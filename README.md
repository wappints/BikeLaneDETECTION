A 4th-year university project in image processing that utilizes computer vision technology 
in detecting bike lanes with *PURELY* traditional image techniques.

Techniques like hough-line transform, perspective transform, binary thresholding, and other methods
were utilized to obtain the presence and number of bike lanes.
